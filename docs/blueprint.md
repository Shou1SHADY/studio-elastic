## Core Features:

- Landing Page Video Frame Animation: Implement a scroll-controlled video frame animation on the landing page, replacing the 3D model. This includes smooth transitions between frames for a dynamic visual storytelling experience.
- Parallax Motion and Pinned Sections: Integrate layered parallax motion effects and pinned hero sections throughout the site, enhancing the high-tech aesthetic and depth perspective.
- Soft Section Transitions: Ensure each section (Hero, About, Our Craft, Gallery, Contact) enters with soft motion, opacity fades, and subtle depth perspective effects for a smooth user experience.
- Bilingual Support (English & Arabic): Provide full bilingual support (English & Arabic) with RTL-compatible layouts to cater to a broader audience.
- Contact Form with Submission to Firebase: Implement a contact form allowing users to inqire on customized rubber keychains and patches. All submission will be handled via Firebase.

- Accent color: Electric purple (#BE95FF) to add a futuristic, artistic touch and highlight key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' for a techy, modern aesthetic. Use 'Inter' for any longer body text.
- Use minimalist, geometric icons with a line art style, incorporating subtle animations on hover to enhance interactivity.
- Design a modular and responsive layout optimized for smooth performance and GPU-friendly animations, ensuring compatibility across devices.
- Implement cinematic scroll-driven animations using GSAP (ScrollTrigger, ScrollSmoother, Timeline) with frame-by-frame motion, pinned sections, and scrubbed transitions, optimized for transform and opacity only.
